   "description": "The Gerrit Rietveld Academie also known as Rietveld School of Art & Design and Rietveld Academy, is a Dutch academy founded in 1924 for the study of fine arts and design in Amsterdam, Netherlands.The Gerrit Rietveld Academy has its origins in the 1924 merger of three schools, which then became known as the Institute of Applied Art, or simply the Applied Arts School. From 1939 to 1960, education was strongly influenced by the functionalist and socially critical ideas of De Stijl and the Bauhaus, partly due to the role of the socialist architect Mart Stam as director of education.Since the 1960s and especially the 1970s, the role and influence of autonomous visual art and individual expression have grown in importance. These influences, combined with a practical focus and a critical mindset, still determine a significant part of the academy's image. In 1967, the school moved to its current academy building, which was designed by architect and furniture designer Gerrit Rietveld.",

The Islamic University of Applied Sciences Rotterdam received her first accreditation in 2010 for her master's degree programme Islamic Spiritual Care and in 2013 for Bachelor program Islamic Theology; both degree programmes are accredited by the NVAO . According to a news article from 2010 the university has close religious ties with the Turkish Nurcu movement.The IUASR offers accredited Bachelors and master's degrees and is called Islamic University of Applied Sciences Rotterdam; the IUASR is not a member of the VSNU , due to the fact that there is slight difference in the names 'University of Applied Sciences' and 'University' pointing to the distinction between having a PhD research programme or not. In this sense the wording 'University' is protected by law. However, the IUASR is starting a PhD application in January 2019 at the NVAO. This doesn't inhibt the IUASR and her accredited degree programmes.From 2003 the university is located in the North of Rotterdam, in a characteristic stately building on the Bergsingel 135. The building previously belonged to Zadkine MLO and provided practical science education and was known as van 't Hof Instituut.The IUASR has the legal accreditation as an institute of Higher Education. In June 2010 the master's degree programme Islamic Spiritual Care was accredited at University of Applied Sciences level, in March 2013 accreditation was given to the Bachelor programme Islamic Theology .

   "description": "Breda University of Applied Sciences is a medium-sized, government-funded higher education institute in Breda, Netherlands. It was founded in 1966 with the merger of two educational institutions. Since, the university has increased in the number of staff, students and programmes offered. According to the annual report in 2017 there were 7,398 students from over 70 countries studying in the university in different types of programmes offered both in English and Dutch.In 1966 vocational university Nederlands Wetenschappelijk Instituut voor Toerisme was founded in Breda. It offered bachelor programmes in tourism and leisure and in this field, it was and still is the largest and leading education institution in the world. In 1987 NWIT merged with the in 1972 founded Verkeersakademie Tilburg , to form Nationale hogeschool voor toerisme en verkeer . In the years following this merger NHTV grew both in offered courses as well as in sheer student numbers. Increasingly, internationalization became the focus, this culminated in a name change in 2001; NHTV internationale hogeschool Breda. NHTV was no longer an abbreviation but rather used as its name. In 2008 Dutch hogeschool was renamed to university of applied sciences in English. Universities of Applied Sciences offer bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and no doctorates. New bachelor and master programmes have been developed since then, closely related to the disciplines.",
